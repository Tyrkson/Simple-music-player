This project was made as the final project in one of the web courses I took.

The program tries to read mp3 files from the default music directory on Windows 10 (This program is only tested on Win 10) and if needed then the user can add manually too. 

The player can only play songs from the beginning thus not possible to pause. Also there is a slider for volume control.
